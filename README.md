# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
For this project I made a simple app that shows a new space-picture every day. I used the NASA apod API (astronomy picture of the day) to fetch data from. Then I made the app multiscreen using react navigation.
I started this project by sketching on an idea that would use some API and when I found the NASA apod API I sketched on an idea of how the app should function based on that API. I knew I wanted to make a multiscreen app also.
If I had more time I would like to improve the styling and add some more functionality like for example a social media sharing function, links to NASA, and I would also like to explore how to implement a Lottie-animation. I might come back to the project in the future to improve it further.
